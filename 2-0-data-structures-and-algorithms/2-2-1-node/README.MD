Implement a class **Node â€“ a building block** that is used in order to create **LinkedList**, **LinkedQueue** and other
important data structures.

### Task

Your job is to implement the class `Node<T>` itself and then all util methods of class `Nodes`.  
To verify your implementation, run `NodesTest.java`.

### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:

You're supposed to be familiar Java classes and generics.

### How to start :question:

* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **completed** branch and see the final implementation
